Post-doc at CREATIS, Lyon, France.  
I defended my PhD on the 11/04/2024.  
My PhD subject was on anomaly detection for neuroimaging, and more specifically representation learning and probability support estimation methods.  
Applications include white matter hyperintensities detection, epileptogenic lesion detection, and Parkinson versus healthy classification.
