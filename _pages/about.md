You are on the professional webpage of Nicolas Pinon, PhD in image processing. My research interests are machine learning (especially anomaly detection) and medical applications (especially medical imaging).    

My PhD subject was on anomaly detection for neuroimaging, and more specifically representation learning and probability support estimation methods. Applications include white matter hyperintensities detection, epileptogenic lesion detection, and Parkinson versus healthy classification.   

I'm searching for a post-doc for 2026, feel free to contact me at : nicolas.e.pinon at laposte.net.
