Post-doc researcher on machine learning for medical imaging.  
My PhD subject was on anomaly detection for neuroimaging, and more specifically representation learning and probability support estimation methods. Applications include white matter hyperintensities detection, epileptogenic lesion detection, and Parkinson versus healthy classification.   

Currently in a professional break, in search of a post-doc for Autumn/Winter 2025, feel free to contact me at : nicolas.e.pinon at laposte.net.  

Je viens d'être qualifié en section 61 et 27 !
