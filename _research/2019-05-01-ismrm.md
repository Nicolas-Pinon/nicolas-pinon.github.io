excerpt: 'Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is reproducible but often lacks calibration and/or specificity to the underlying microstructure. Light transmission optical histology of stained tissue is a popular method for validation, however, it is hampered by calibration issues and inhomogeneous penetration of staining agents. We propose a method to validate quantitative MRI metrics using stainless histology by utilizing the innate autofluorescence spectra of tissues when excited with ultraviolet laser. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of a qMRI validation pipeline on a pig spinal cord section with in vivo and ex vivo qMRI followed by histological autofluorescence microscopy to quantify myelin content.'
